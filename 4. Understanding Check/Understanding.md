# Understanding Check

In the You Do, you had to store your assignment names and grades in two different `ArrayList` objects.

This is a prime opportunity to utilize objects to condense this down to one `ArrayList` object instead.

You will write the `Assignment` class in the `Assignment.java` file. It should have instance variables to store a name and a grade. Make a `toString` method that will allow your printing of each assignment to be easier.

Then, in `Understanding.java` make an `ArrayList` object that holds assignments. Add the same five assignments you chose from the `You Do` to it, and print them out.

This should produce the same output as the `You Do` assignment, just programmed differently!

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
