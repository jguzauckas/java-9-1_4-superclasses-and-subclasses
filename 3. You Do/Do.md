# You Do

In `Do.java`, you are going to create two paired `ArrayList` objects to store your grades for a class.

One of the `ArrayList` objects will store `String` values as the names of assignments. The other `ArrayList` object will store `double` values representing the percentages earned on the assignments.

Add a minimum of five assignments to the two `ArrayList` objects. Then print out their values together, creating an output like this example for each assignment:

```
Unit 6 Test - 86%
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
